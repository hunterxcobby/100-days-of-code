# 100 Days Of Code -  Progress Log



## Day 0: October 28, 2023 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**:  Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
