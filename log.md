## Day 1: October 30, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: Data Encapsulation, Python 

**Thoughts:**

- When we talk about Data encapsulation, it is the bundling or wrapping of data(attributes) and methods into a single unit
- We can do this for medernization
- But most importantly, it is to ensure that the data is well handled
- This is an implementation of data abstraction
- I love this idea of handling data as python has no strict rules but trusts that programmers will adhere to it
- But it also makes me think that python wouldn't be the best for data encapsualtion

## Day 4: November 2, 2023 


**Today's Progress**: Playing with Characters Challenge, C language

**Thoughts:**

- I solved a challenge today called playing with characters
- It invloves taking a character, a string an line of sentence as an input
- Then you print it to the standard output
- This involves the use of the `printf` and `scanf` function
- The scanf function would normally take input until it encounters a space
- The challenge today was about how to counter such problem
- It invloves the use of the scanset format specifiers in this form;

```C
  char s[MAX_LEN];
scanf("\n"); // Consume the newline character left in the buffer
scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); // Use this to solve the problem
```
   - Explanation:
     - `%[^\n]` is a scanset format specifier. It tells `scanf` to read characters until it encounters a newline (`\n`).
     - `%*c` is used to read and discard the newline character.
   - Note: The `%*c` is needed to consume the newline character left in the input buffer after the previous `scanf`. If you omit it, the next `scanf` will not work correctly.

## Day 7: November 5, 2023 


**Today's Progress**:  Pointers challenge, C language

**Thoughts:**

 - In simple terms,
 - A pointer is like a label that points to a location where some data is stored.
 - Pointers are very useful for tasks where you need to work with memory efficiently.
 - Use pointers when;
   - You need to allocate memory for data at runtime
   - When you want to modify a variable in a function and have that change reflected outside the function, you pass the variable's address (a pointer) instead of the value itself.
   - Implementing data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs relies heavily on pointers for creating and navigating nodes.
- while pointers are powerful, they require careful handling to avoid issues like memory leaks and pointer arithmetic errors.

**Today's Progress**: Sorting Algorithm, The Insertion, Quick and Merge Sort, C language

1.  Insertion Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Insertion Sort:**
  - **Algorithmic Paradigm:** Iterative.
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1) as it doesn't require additional space.
  - **Key Features:** Simple to implement, adaptive, stable, and efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

2. Quick Sort:is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- **Algorithmic Paradigm:** Divide and Conquer.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Worst Case: O(n^2) - Occurs when the partitioning is consistently unbalanced.
  - Average Case: O(n log n) - Efficient for a wide range of inputs.
  - Best Case: O(n log n) - Occurs when the pivot divides the array into roughly equal halves.
  - Space Complexity: O(log n) - Recursive calls in the call stack.
- **Key Features:**
  - Efficient for large datasets.
  - In-place sorting - Doesn't require additional memory.
  - Unstable - Equal elements might not maintain their original order.
  - Adaptive - Performance can be improved with optimizations like choosing the median of     
  three elements as the pivot.

3. **Merge Sort:**
- **Algorithmic Paradigm:** Divide and Conquer.
-  **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases. Merge Sort consistently maintains this efficiency across different scenarios.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) additional space is required for the temporary storage during the merging process, making it less memory-efficient than Insertion Sort for large datasets.
- **Key Features:**
   - **Stability:** Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative order in the sorted output.
   - **Efficiency:** It performs well on large datasets due to its consistent O(n log n) time complexity.
   - **Divide and Conquer:** The algorithm breaks the problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them independently, and then combines the solutions to solve the original problem.
   - **Adaptability:** Merge Sort's performance is not significantly affected by the initial order of the elements, making it suitable for a wide range of input scenarios.

## Day 26: November 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: file test operators, shell scripting

-**File Test Operators**

- File test operators in Bash are used to check various attributes and properties of files.
- They are commonly used in conditional statements to make decisions based on the existence, type, or properties of files.

- `-e file`: Returns true if the file exists.

  Example: `if [ -e "myfile.txt" ]; then echo "File exists"; fi`

- `-f file`: Returns true if the file is a regular file (not a directory or device file).

  Example: `if [ -f "document.pdf" ]; then echo "It's a regular file"; fi`

- `-d file`: Returns true if the file is a directory.

  Example: `if [ -d "myfolder" ]; then echo "It's a directory"; fi`

- `-s file`: Returns true if the file is not zero size.

  Example: `if [ -s "nonemptyfile.txt" ]; then echo "File is not empty"; fi`

- `-r file`: Returns true if the file has read permission.

  Example: `if [ -r "readablefile.txt" ]; then echo "File is readable"; fi`

- `-w file`: Returns true if the file has write permission.

  Example: `if [ -w "writablefile.txt" ]; then echo "File is writable"; fi`

- `-x file`: Returns true if the file has execute permission.

  Example: `if [ -x "executablescript.sh" ]; then echo "Script is executable"; fi`
These operators provide a powerful way to perform file-related checks in Bash scripts, enabling you to make decisions and take actions based on the properties of files.

## Day 35: December 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Runner-Up Score Finder, Python

**Thoughts:**
- **Understanding the Problem:**  the task is relatively straightforward: find the second-highest score in a list.

- **Input Handling:** The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scores and a list of integers as input. This is a good opportunity to practice handling input in Python.

- **Finding Unique Scores:** Converting the list to a set to find unique scores is a good approach. However, it's essential to handle cases where there might be fewer than two distinct scores.

- **Edge Cases:** The code should handle edge cases gracefully. For example, if there's only one unique score, there's no runner-up. The provided solution includes a check for this scenario.

## Day 37: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: The cmd module, Python
The `Cmd` class in Python provides a simple framework for building line-oriented command interpreters. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Purpose:**
   - It's designed for creating command-line interpreters, which are handy for building tools, administrative utilities, or prototypes that might later get a fancier interface.

2. **Class Definition:**
   - `class cmd.Cmd(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)`
   - When you create an instance of `Cmd`, you're essentially setting up a framework for handling commands and providing an interactive interface.

3. **Usage:**
   - You typically don't directly use `Cmd` but instead subclass it. By doing this, you inherit the methods provided by `Cmd` and can define your own methods to handle specific commands.

4. **Completion Key:**
   - The `completekey` argument is optional and defaults to 'Tab'. If the `readline` library is available, it enables automatic command completion when the user hits the specified key.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - You can specify input and output file objects using the `stdin` and `stdout` arguments. If not provided, they default to `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`.

6. **Raw Input:**
   - If you want to use a specific `stdin`, ensure to set the instance's `use_rawinput` attribute to `False`. This prevents ignoring the specified `stdin`.
