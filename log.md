# 100 Days Of Code -  Progress Log

### This is a round 1 of my 100DaysOfCode challenge.


## Day 0: October 29, 2023 


**Today's Progress**:  Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
