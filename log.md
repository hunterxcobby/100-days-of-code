# 100 Days Of Code -  Progress Log

### This is a round 1 of my 100DaysOfCode challenge.


## Day 0: October 29, 2023 


**Today's Progress**:  Test-Driven Development, Python(The Docstring Module)

**Thoughts:**

- I started implementing the use of the `doctest module` to test my codes and I also discovered the `"unittest"`.
- There are a lot of flag options you can add to make the testing easier.
- I always write notes with sample codes as to help new learners and the future me as a reference.
- The link to the sample codes is down below
- Like usual, starting to learn something new is a bit challenging but with the right mindset, you can figure it out!
- Keep on coding !
